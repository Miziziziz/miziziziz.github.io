   <h1>Affiliate Program</h1>
   <p>
   I have an affiliate program where content creators can promote my games and get a cut of the sales revenue.
   </p>
   <h2>Program Details</h2>
   <p>
   Affiliates receive 50% of sales revenue after discounts, transaction fees, and sales tax.<br> 
   
   Payouts have a $50 minimum threshold.<br>
   Payouts will be done on the 15th of every month for all sales older than 30 days after this threshold is reached.<br> 
   You must have a Wise account to receive payouts.<br> 
   <br> 
   Transactions are processed through Stripe; transaction fees info can be found here: 
   <a class="text-link" href="https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods">https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods</a>
   <br> 
   <br> 
   I'm based in Florida, which has no sales tax for digital products, but for sales to other countries that might change.
   <br> 
   <br> 
   <b>Example sale commission:</b><br> 
   Game price: $10<br> 
   Promo code 10% off: $10 - $1 = $9<br> 
   Stripe fee 3.4% + 30c: $9 - $0.66 = $8.34<br>
   Final commission 50%: $8.34 * 0.5 = $4.17<br>
   You get: $4.17<br>
   </p>
